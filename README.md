I'm a Junior at CSU Monterey Bay, taking steps into the software development world. M
y big draw to computer science and software is the ability to shape and direct computers as a tool to get what you want done. 
Great software and automation in both virtual and physical spaces has always exemplified this to me, which is why I'm always eager to find new ways to apply computing.

To this end, I'm currently taking classes in a variety of languages and getting to know a whole suite of tools for aspiring developers like myself. 
My current internship has taught me leaps and bounds as well, and I've gotten a lot of practice with web development and MVC framework. 
I'm always eager to try new things, learn new languages or tools, and make new applications or other fun bits.
